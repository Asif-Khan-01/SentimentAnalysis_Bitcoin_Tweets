## 🔬 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- **Source:** Kaggle Bitcoin Tweets Dataset
- **Volume:** 50,000+ tweets (sampled to 49,921)
- **Period:** February 5 - April 12, 2021 (66 days)
- **Price Data:** Yahoo Finance BTC-USD

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
```python
✓ Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags
✓ Convert to lowercase
✓ Remove special characters and stopwords
✓ Tokenization and cleaning
✓ Result: 49,921 clean tweets
```

### 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
- **Tool:** VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- **Output:** Compound scores from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)
- **Classification:** 
  - Positive: score ≥ 0.05
  - Negative: score ≤ -0.05
  - Neutral: -0.05 < score < 0.05

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering

**For Text Models (Model 1 & 3):**
- TF-IDF vectorization with 5,000 features
- Bi-gram support (n-gram range: 1-2)
- Individual tweet-level analysis

**For Price Prediction (Model 2):**
- Daily aggregated sentiment scores
- Tweet volume and engagement metrics
- Price volatility and trading volume
- Technical indicators

### 5️⃣ Model Training

**🔹 Model 1: Logistic Regression**
- Binary classification (Positive vs Negative/Neutral)
- TF-IDF features (5,000 dimensions)
- Training time: 30 seconds
- **Result: 91.95% accuracy**

**🔹 Model 2: Random Forest**
- Predicts price movement (UP/DOWN)
- 100 estimators, max depth 10
- Features: sentiment, volume, volatility
- **Result: 42.86% accuracy** (limited by small dataset)

**🔹 Model 3: LSTM Neural Network**
- Bidirectional LSTM architecture
- Layers: Embedding(128) → Bi-LSTM(64) → Bi-LSTM(32) → Dense(64)
- Dropout regularization (0.5)
- 10 epochs, batch size 64
- **Result: 95.78% accuracy** 🏆

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Deep Learning Dominates Text Analysis
LSTM captured complex sentiment patterns better than traditional ML, achieving **95.78% accuracy** vs 91.95% for Logistic Regression.

### 2. Sentiment-Price Correlation
Positive sentiment shows strong correlation with Bitcoin price increases:
- Days with avg sentiment > 0.15: **67% price increase**
- Days with avg sentiment < 0: **58% price decrease**

### 3. Feature Importance (Random Forest)
```
Price Volatility:    41.09%
Trading Volume:      33.81%
Average Sentiment:    6.83%
Tweet Count:          6.72%
Engagement Rate:      6.54%
```

### 4. Data Quality Impact
Random Forest struggled (42.86%) due to:
- Small aggregated dataset (only 15 days with tweets in test set)
- Missing engagement data (likes/retweets unavailable)
- Time-series challenges with limited samples

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| 💾 Memory errors with 2GB dataset | Processed data in 5,000-row chunks |
| 📅 Date mismatch (tweets 2021, prices 2024) | Re-downloaded prices for matching dates |
| 📉 Random Forest low accuracy | Identified small dataset as root cause |
| 🔢 Missing engagement metrics | Added synthetic engagement features |
| 🐛 Git push failed (file too large) | Added CSV files to .gitignore |
